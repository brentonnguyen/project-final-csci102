            <p><br> Rework is a moving company founded in 2015. As CEO John Doe moved homes frequently, he noticed that most moving companies were quite similar and lacked uniqueness. Many of the services provided by these companies were standard, making it difficult to find a reliable and distinctive option. This realization led to the founding of Rework, which offers affordable prices for a high-end experience.
            <br> What sets Rework apart is its strict approach to employee selection, ensuring that only the best employees are hired. This commitment to quality has proven successful, as evidenced by the company’s growing base of recurring and a surge of new clients. In 2016, Rework further emphasized the brand’s impact itself by hiring full-time interior designer veterans. With interior designers, the moving process is smoother and helps clients adjust more comfortably to their new homes.
            <br> In 2017, Rework made a huge investment in many storage warehouses, offering clients convenient temporary storage solutions for their belongings. This addition has proven to be extremely beneficial and stress-relieving for clients during their transition.
            Rework’s commitment to excellence has been recognized with several awards, including an accolade from Awwwards.com for best website design. As rework stands today, the company has recently expanded globally, having headquarters in many U.S. states and is soon to be opening in Japan, Korea, etc.
